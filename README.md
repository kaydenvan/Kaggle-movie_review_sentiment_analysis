# Kaggle Competition
This repository contains the code for a Kaggle competition, [Sentiment Analysis on Movie Reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/c/sentiment-analysis-on-movie-reviews/overview
)

### First Submission
With a quick start, LSTM is used without any word cleansing for the dataset. The score is 0.63621, which is a very competitive score. However, since the competition is ended, ranking could be only found manually. Hence, it is 208 out of 860 (top 25%).
